## Installation Instructions

### UNIX

#### Build from Source on Linux/Unix/Mac

For basic compile and install instructions on Linux/Unix platforms, check out
the [install instructions](INSTALL.autotools.md).

For detailed instructions specific to building ClamAV please investigate
our the
[Linux/Unix/Mac Install instructions in the User Manual](https://www.clamav.net/documents/installing-clamav-on-unix-linux-macos-from-source).

For instructions on how to build ClamAV using our new *experimental* CMake
build tooling, see [INSTALL.cmake.md](INSTALL.cmake.md)

#### Install from a binary package

For binary package distribution installation instructions, head over to
[our website](https://www.clamav.net/documents/installing-clamav).

### Windows

#### Build from Source on Windows

The instructions for building ClamAV from source on Windows is located in the
[Win32 README](win32/README.md).

#### Using an Install Package

We provide an installer to install ClamAV on Windows to "C:\\Program Files".
This install method will require you to have Adminstrator priveleges.

We also provide a "Portable Install Package" (i.e. a zip of the required files)
for users that may wish to run ClamAV without installing it to a system-owned
directory.

For details on how to use either option, head over to the
[Windows Install instructions in the User Manual](https://www.clamav.net/documents/installing-clamav-on-windows).

For instructions on how to build ClamAV using our new *experimental* CMake
build tooling, see [INSTALL.cmake.md](INSTALL.cmake.md)

## Licensing

ClamAV is licensed for public/open source use under the GNU General Public
License, Version 2 (GPLv2).

See `COPYING.txt` for a copy of the license.

### 3rd Party Code

ClamAV contains a number of components that include code copied in part or in
whole from 3rd party projects and whose code is not owned by Cisco and which
are licensed differently than ClamAV. These include:

- tomsfastmath:  public domain
- LLVM: Illinois Open Source License (BSD-like)
- Yara: Apache 2.0 license
  - Yara has since switched to the BSD 3-Clause License;
    Our source is out-of-date and needs to be updated.
- 7z / lzma: public domain
- libclamav's NSIS/NulSoft parser includes:
  - zlib: permissive free software license
  - bzip2 / libbzip2: BSD-like license
- OpenBSD's libc/regex: BSD license
- file: BSD license
- str.c: Contains BSD licensed modified-implementations of strtol(), stroul()
  functions, Copyright (c) 1990 The Regents of the University of California.
- pngcheck (png.c): MIT/X11-style license
- getopt.c: MIT license
- Curl: license inspired by MIT/X, but not identical
- libmspack: LGPL license
- UnRAR (libclamunrar): a non-free/restricted open source license
  - Note: The UnRAR license is incompatible with GPLv2 because it contains a
    clause that prohibits reverse engineering a RAR compression algorithm from
    the UnRAR decompression code.
    For this reason, libclamunrar/libclamunrar_iface is not linked at all with
    libclamav. It is instead loaded at run-time. If it fails to load, ClamAV
    will continue running without RAR support.

See the `COPYING` directory for a copy of the 3rd party project licenses.
